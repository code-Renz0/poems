        Do you keep a diary?<br />
        I do, not the regular kind (like the ones with dates and stuff that
        talks about one's day)but a different kind.<br />
        I reflecth at times, sort of a habit i kept from my time in the
        seminary.<br />
        I find myself reflecting, especially when alone.<br />
        words come to mind, words with depth and meaning in the most creative of
        manner.<br />
        And then i think to write them but in that moment they begin to elude
        me, like sand they seive through my fingers as i try to grasp at
        them.<br />
        They elude me cause they do not wish to be written, because if they were
        then they are nomore hidden but free to wrick untold havoc.

          a place where i store my life's events<br />
          the first person i wish to tell anything worth telling<br />

          weird, one word one Syllable<br />
          i see her coming and i get confused like a weirdo<br />
          trying to get these thoughts together but no-comprendo<br />
          she's smart, she's beautiful, she's like a devil<br />
          no evil just that strong dark complexion<br />

          i can't sleep<br />
          i wake up at night and can't return to sleep<br />
          i close my eyes but still no sleep <br />
          she comes for me,<br />
          At night like a shadow she creaps into my mind<br />
          i try to fight to go to sleep<br />
          i tried and tried, still no sleep<br />
          but then i dug in deep within and searched for he who lived within<br />for courage fears evil twin<br />
           it told me of all i'll do <br />
          of tales of sun and tales of moon<br />
          and after words  to sleep return <br />

          I sat at night a poem to write<br />
          I sat for long but naught i write<br />
          For deep was that which plagued thine mind<br />
          and ceased thy sleep from within thine eyes<br />
          wishing for words that i might write<br />
          i'm lost on how to make things right<br />
          for lo i'd love to make her smile<br />
          and woe my heart wish she was mine<br />
          but words alone can not surfice<br />
          and so to bed i must retire<br />
          it seems a poet i am not<br />
          i'm just a man who likes a woman <br />
          but seem a fish whos out of water.

          Frendship!<br />
          An abstract noun, as volatile as it is unseen, a bond stronger than
          blood.<br />
          It's pull like gravity, grounding us to those we feel ourselves the
          most with.<br />
          We presume to choose but it chooses us.<br />
          Like a web it weaves,piecing us together like uneven pieces of a
          puzzle, our diversities not withstanding<br />
          Forged from human emotions love and kindness, pain and anger and
          more<br />
          It bends but can brake, strengthend and weakens, can turn to hate.<br />
          It's hard as steel, brittle as clay.

          What if the day was night and the night was day and all that hid came
          out to play? <br />

          What if you were mine and i was yours and nothing else mattered for
          just today?<br />

          My mind!<br />
          A being of it's own,<br />
          in constant contrast with my every thought<br />
          an infinite pool of possibilities,<br />
          a void as endless as space and time itself.<br />
          It speaks to me, like a voice from deep within, <br />
          soft as the wind it courses through me with words as clear as
          visions.<br />
          like a soothsayer, a seer, an oracle,it tells me tales .<br />
          tales of dreams and nightmares, of joy and sadness, of pain and
          pleasure, of fantacies that may never be.<br /> it speaks of hidden
          truths and fears, of struggles deep down, of lonliness, of shame.<br />
          it
          is a ward,a demension, a plane , a tatrous for the most vile of
          thoughts,<br />my very own asylum.

          how fairs the queen and the young prince and princessa?<br />
          for i miss that chunk of chocolate sweetness,the Lady Bell<br />
          and the cute prince of steez,Lord Marvel<br />
          oh what joy would such pumpkins rain on the lord and Lady for birthing
          such treasures<br />
          for it is only fitting that treasures be formed from great marbles<br />
          Bless your union and the lord for anointing it <br />
          and bless us all for being an extention of your happiness<br />
